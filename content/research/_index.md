I develop novel methods in **computational cosmology** to test gravity and dark matter across cosmic scales.

#### Highlights
- **VErTIGO**: Velocity-based tests of gravity  
- **COLAB**: Cosmic-Web laboratory for baryons & DM  
- **LUSTRE**: Constrained Local Universe simulations  
- **Other**: 4HS, DUDEG, OPUS projects
