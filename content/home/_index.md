I am **Wojciech A. Hellwing**, an Associate Professor at the Center for Theoretical Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences.  
With over 15 years in computational cosmology, my work fuses large‐scale structure simulations, modified gravity theories, and cosmic velocity fields to tackle two of modern physics’ great mysteries:

1. **The true nature of dark matter and dark energy** – I develop and run state-of-the-art N-body and hydrodynamical simulations under both General Relativity and alternatives, creating mock surveys and novel observables.  
2. **Tests of gravity on cosmic scales** – Through velocity and density statistics, I design independent probes of General Relativity and its contenders, preparing for next-generation surveys (DESI, Euclid, LSST).

During my ERC Starting Grant (VErTIGO, 2016–2021), I built the ECOSMOG simulation suite and led the development of new analytics for galaxy velocities. Today, I lead an international team advancing our understanding of the cosmic web, galaxy formation, and fundamental physics.
